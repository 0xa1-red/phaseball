        <h2>
            Welcome to the first playtest of Phaseball!
        </h2>

        <h3>
            What is Phaseball?
        </h3>
        <div class="wot">
            <p>
                Phaseball is a baseball "game" - I like to use the term story generator -
                based on <a href="https://wmakers.net/deadball" target="_blank">Deadball</a> by W.M. Akers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The idea behind Phaseball is to give the players a way to simulate baseball games in their own world.
                Do you want to create a league for you and your friends? Sure can do! Do you want to add every team
                yourself? Why not? The goal is to create storylines in the context of baseball.
            </p>
            <p>
                What we're planning to do to help people achieve this is to create an easy to use web interface
                and a robust match simulation engine so you only have to focus on the lore of your world or the
                results of the games - whichever you think is more important.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>
            What is playtesting?
        </h3>
        <div class="wot">
            <p>
                As of now, we're rolling out the first version of the match engine and to test it, we'll
                need teams. To get more teams and also get more people involved - and possibly invested in
                our project, we're asking <b>you</b> to send us team compositions!
            </p>
            <p>
                We'll review every team sheet and decide if they can get in the first testing phase. Don't
                be afraid, the bar is not too high. Just be decent with the names and follow the rules for
                generating teams!
            </p>
        </div>

        <h3>
            Alright, what are the rules then?
        </h3>
        <div class="wot">
            <p>
                They're not too complicated. All you need is a 10 sided die (or an online tool) and a way to
                jot the results down. (Google Spreadsheets, pastebin, whatever you'll be able to share with us!)
            </p>
            <p>
                The team sheet should include your email address (we won't show it to anyone, we'll only use it to
                contact you about the team), your GM name (doesn't have to be your real name), your team name and
                9 players (for each position).
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Important: we reserve the right to reject teams for any reason.<br />
                    Don't take it the wrong way unless we tell you to.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                The following information is needed for <b>hitters</b>:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Name</li>
                    <li>Position</li>
                    <li>Batter target - generate rolling <b>2D10+15</b></li>
                    <li>Handedness</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The following information is needed for the <b>pitcher</b>:<br />
                <ul>
                    <li>Name</li>
                    <li>Position</li>
                    <li>Batter target - generate rolling <b>D10+5</b></li>
                    <li>Pitch die</li>
                    <li>Handedness</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                The positions, just to make sure we're on the same page:

                <ul>
                    <li>Pitcher - P</li>
                    <li>Catcher - C</li>
                    <li>First baseman - 1B</li>
                    <li>Second baseman - 2B</li>
                    <li>Third baseman - 3B</li>
                    <li>Shortstop - SS</li>
                    <li>Left fielder - LF</li>
                    <li>Center fielder - CF</li>
                    <li>Right fielder - RF</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                To generate the pitch die, roll a D8 and pick the result from this table:
                <table>
                    <tr class="head"><td class="roll">Roll</td><td>Pitch die</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>1</td><td>D12</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>2</td><td>D8</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>3</td><td>D8</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>4</td><td>D4</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>5</td><td>D4</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>6</td><td>D4</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>7</td><td>-D4</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>8</td><td>-D4</td></tr>
                </table>
            </p>
            <p>
                To generate the handedness, roll a D10 and pick the result from this table:
                <table>
                    <tr class="head"><td class="roll">Roll</td><td>Handedness</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>0</td><td><b>Hitter</b>: Switch<br /><b>Pitcher</b>: Left handed</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>1-6</td><td>Right handed</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>7-9</td><td>Left handed</td></tr>
                </table>
            </p>
            <p>
